# study-and-practice
This repository is for my "Coding Study &amp; Practice" demo website. It is very ugly because I only use it to try random things as I learn them and to practice debugging... I don't worry about the design aspect of it whatsoever, so it is quite a clusterfluff.

If you want to help me out when I get stuck and create an issue, please be ready to leave a detailed explanation (and be willing to answer additional questions) so I can learn it for myself :) Thank you!

PS. If you do an awesome job at helping me get the hang of things-- i.e., not just giving me the answers without providing any real knowledge behind them-- and contribute regularly, you can link this repository to your professional materials (just explain to people that you were helping a noob become less noob-ish, and that's why it's such a hot mess), and I will be happy to act as a reference to your awesome tutelage.
